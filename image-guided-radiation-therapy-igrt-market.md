<p><strong>The Image-guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-line Correction</li><li>Off-line Correction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Image-guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) enhances the precision of radiation treatment by using imaging techniques to verify and adjust patient positioning before or during therapy. The market is divided into two main types: online correction and offline correction. Online correction involves real-time adjustments based on imaging performed just before treatment, ensuring precise targeting as the tumor and surrounding tissues may shift. Offline correction, in contrast, refers to adjustments made after imaging but before the next treatment session, thus relying on previous scans for positioning.</p></p>
