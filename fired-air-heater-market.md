<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Air Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired</li><li>Indirect Fired</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fired air heater market is divided into two main types: direct fired and indirect fired. Direct fired heaters burn fuel directly in the air stream, providing immediate heat and high efficiency, making them suitable for applications requiring quick temperature changes. In contrast, indirect fired heaters utilize a heat exchanger to transfer heat to the air, avoiding direct combustion exposure. This method offers safer operation and cleaner air, ideal for environments requiring stringent air quality control.</p></p>
